Women's Habitat

Challenges:
1.  Create a solution that improves and enhances the functionality and visual appeal of our online donation system.
3.  Create a solution that improves our ability to find and leverage donors.

Women's Habitat is a long standing charity that helps women who suffer physical and/or mental abuse and other adverse conditions 
such as addiction/substance abuse or family breakdown.  Due to their very nature of concerns addressed and as a non-profit charitable
local organization in Canada's largest city the sheer volume of perpetually increasing need constitutes a significantly critical 
financial need for donor support.  Abused, stressed, victimized, impoverished women are not encouraged in putting their voices 
or faces forward to speak out, defend or simply advocate for themselves or others in similar situations due to embarrassment, 
chronic threats, lack of independent means and ongoing legal issues.  Yes such women especially upon successfully recovering if only 
temporarily comprise the principal donor source along with their friends, co-workers, relatives and peers in being the being most 
favourably disposed towards giving back to Women's Habitat.  We have reviewed in particular the Women's Habitat online donor solicitation 
effectiveness in particular the required donor processes and donor page appearance and have sought with our presentation to facilitate, 
encourage and even enhance the entire donor experiences for anyone considering or who actually donates anything to facilitate the charity's
funding effectiveness.  Our presentation simplifies accessibility yet also expands the potential Women's Habitat donor net by stressing 
convenience, expediency, security, confidentiality and overall user friendliness for donors.
